# Object_Tracking_based_on_Color

- Object detection and tracking are the task that is important and challenging such as video surveillance and vehicle navigation.
- Image processing is a method of extracting some useful information by converting image into digital inform by performing some operations on it. 

HSV Value:
- HSL and HSV are alternative representations of the RGB color model, designed in the 1970s by computer graphics researchers to more closely align with the way human vision perceives color-making attributes
- HSV Color Space. The HSV color space (hue, saturation, value) is often used by people who are selecting colors (e.g., of paints or inks) from a color wheel or palette, because it corresponds better to how people experience color than the RGB color space does.
